Level 1 AngularJs Task

1. I have created index.html that gives the option to choose a country from the drop down.
  a. If you start entering number in the text box with label Phone Number, you will see Number formatting being applied to the text-box and also also   to the label below it.
  b. To get the text-box formatting I have created a directive that employs $watch to listen to changes in the text-box and apply formatting.
  c. To show case the filter I applied formatting on the label that follow the text entered in the text-box.
